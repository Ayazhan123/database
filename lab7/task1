1.How can we store large-object types?

Many database applications need to store attributes whose domain consists of large
data items such as a photo, a high-resolution medical image, or a video. SQL, therefore,
provides large-object data types for character data (clob) and binary data (blob). The
letters “lob” in these data types stand for “Large OBject.” For example, we may declare
attributes

book review clob(10KB)
image blob(10MB)
movie blob(2GB)

For result tuples containing large objects (multiple megabytes to gigabytes), it is
inefficient or impractical to retrieve an entire large object into memory. Instead, an
application would usually use an SQL query to retrieve a “locator” for a large object
and then use the locator to manipulate the object from the host language in which
the application itself is written. For instance, the JDBC application program interface
(described in Section 5.1.1) permits a locator to be fetched instead of the entire large
object; the locator can then be used to fetch the large object in small pieces, rather than
all at once, much like reading data from an operating system file using a read function
call. When a query returns a large-object, a pointer is returned rather than the large-object itself.
